AB This paper describes a proton high resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic study of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) leaves to characterise metabolic adaptations during leaf growth and exposure to mancozeb. Metabolite variations were identified through multivariate analysis and checked through spectral integration. Lettuce growth was accompanied by activation of energetic metabolism, preferential glucose use and changes in amino acids, phospholipids, ascorbate, nucleotides and nicotinatelnicotinamide. Phenylalanine and polyphenolic variations suggested higher oxidative stress at later growth stages. Exposure to mancozeb induced changes in amino acids, fumarate and malate, suggesting Krebs cycle up-regulation. In tandem disturbances in sugar, phospholipid, nucleotide and nicotinate/nicotinamide metabolism were noted. Additional changes in phenylalanine, dehydroascorbate, tartrate and formate were consistent with a higher demand for anti-oxidant defence mechanisms. Overall, lettuce exposure to mancozeb was shown to have a significant impact on plant metabolism, with mature leaves tending to be more extensively affected than younger leaves.
